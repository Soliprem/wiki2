Man</h1>
<p>Lost in his errand was<br />
the man tucked because<br />
o’ winterfall ’n his jacket<br />
wooly soft<br />
monotony of a rachet.<br />
Papers holds him dear for oft<br />
food on his table have they brought,<br />
withers his heart in shameful<br />
sunshine visions of pleading thought,<br />
his loves scream with power forceful.<br />
Cuddled’s he by the grim hug,<br />
caressed by the softest touch,<br />
wretched in fear and agony brightful<br />
smile sees as he’d never witnessed such.<br />
Delightful raised his head on the premise,<br />
lightful pride praised by, sat he upon the crevice.<br />
Forgotten his wrongs forever shall be.<br />
Of him shall the burdened ever be free.</p>
