<h1>Dissonance</h1>
<p>It was a not-so-stormy night, in the most ordinary of cities in the far west of Saint Bartholomew Road. The morning was by then half spent.<br />
There's no point in all of this, they thought in a mumbling voice. 
It was shining bright on the dying star of Betelgeuse, and the calm atmosphere of the evening made them drousy.<br />
<em>drousy</em><br />
Look at me, they thought. Unison.<br />
Fire and quelling.<br />
Will to power.<br />
Scarcity was high, gains were hot. Yet hollow-sounding-of-broken-promises.<br />
Dancing music was playing all-around. Circenses!<br />
Panem pro omnibus!<br />
Cos'è la vita se non delizia? Je ne peux pas l'imaginer autrement<br />
Gotta run, now, he thought again. His voice a tad louder.<br />
Her sounds shrouded by the crowd and stomped on by the ground, their feet aching from movement, and their wallet light from squandering, the legs took charge.<br />
Du bist die ruh, cantò avviandosi. There's very little that I ever left to chaos.</p>
