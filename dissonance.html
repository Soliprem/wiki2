<h1 id="dissonance">Dissonance</h1>
<p>It was a not-so-stormy night, in the most ordinary of cities in the
far west of Saint Bartholomew Road. The morning was by then half
spent.<br />
There’s no point in all of this, they thought in a mumbling voice. It
was shining bright on the dying star of Betelgeuse, and the calm
atmosphere of the evening made them drousy.<br />
<em>drousy</em><br />
Look at me, they thought. Unison.<br />
Fire and quelling.<br />
Will to power.<br />
Scarcity was high, gains were hot. Yet
hollow-sounding-of-broken-promises.<br />
Dancing music was playing all-around. Circenses!<br />
Panem pro omnibus!<br />
Cos’è la vita se non delizia? Je ne peux pas l’imaginer autrement<br />
Gotta run, now, he thought again. His voice a tad louder.<br />
Her sounds shrouded by the crowd and stomped on by the ground, their
feet aching from movement, and their wallet light from squandering, the
legs took charge.<br />
Du bist die ruh, cantò avviandosi. There’s very little that I ever left
to chaos.</p>
